# CoreML-Models Links

## CoreML-Models projects and resources.

#  With Core ML, you can integrate trained machine learning models into your app.

CoreML-Models is the result of applying a machine learning algorithm to a set of training data. The model makes predictions based on new input data. For example, a model that's been trained on a region's historical house prices may be able to predict a house's price when given the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

* [coremltools](https://apple.github.io/coremltools/index.html) - Core ML is an Apple framework that allows developers to easily integrate machine learning (ML) models into apps. Core ML is availiable on iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. Core ML introduces a public file format (.mlmodel) for a broad set of ML methods including deep neural networks (convolutional and recurrent), tree ensembles (boosted trees, random forest, decision trees), and generalized linear models. Core ML models directly integrate into apps within Xcode.

* [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) - This repository contains machine learning models implemented in TensorFlow. The models are maintained by their respective authors. To propose a model for inclusion, please submit a pull request.

* [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo) - Lots of researchers and engineers have made Caffe models for different tasks with all kinds of architectures and data: check out the model zoo! 

* [TensorFlow Slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/slim/README.md) - TF-slim is a new lightweight high-level API of TensorFlow (tensorflow.contrib.slim) for defining, training and evaluating complex models.
